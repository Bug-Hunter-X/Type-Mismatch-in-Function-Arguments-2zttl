# Type Mismatch in Function Arguments

This repository demonstrates a common TypeScript error related to type mismatches in function arguments. The `add` function is defined to accept two numbers but is called with a string and a number, resulting in a type error.

The `bug.ts` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.ts` file demonstrates how to fix the issue by ensuring the correct types are passed to the function. This simple example is meant to illustrate a fundamental concept in TypeScript type safety and how to resolve such errors.
